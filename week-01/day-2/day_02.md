Good afternoon. My name is Eugene. It's really nice to see you and have this chance to intruduce myself. 

Suzhou is my hometown, I am a native here. And in the past 3 years, I was studying in Germany to get my master degree. In the first year, I took a German courses in Germany to adapt the living life there. Then I went to Technische UniversitÃ¤t Chemnitz to study automotive software engineering. I got my master degree 5 months ago. And I joined EPAM 1 month ago. 

My master thesis topic is data fusion of 3D data from multiple sensors. The evaluation platform for my thesis is a web application by using ReactJS and NodeJS. So in general, I have advanced knowledge for front-end development already. So I wanna strength my skill not just learn something new in JSA project. Thx.
